# Wheeler-DeWitt holography

This repository is associated with the paper "Holography from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation" by Chandramouli Chowdhury, Victor Godet, Olga Papadoulaki and Suvrat Raju (https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14802). It contains a Mathematica notebook written with xAct (http://www.xact.es) and xPert (https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0824) which checks the equations reported in this paper.
